  "The Depths" is a dungeon crawling game where the user will have to find their way through a cave filled with enemies. The rooms in the game will rely on graphs to determine which rooms are adjacent to each room. As the user navigates, they will find health potions and different weapons that will help them in combat with the monsters lurking in this cavern. A very simple map will display every time the user moves, and it will show every room the user has visited along with where they currently are. Users will come across various single cell rooms where there is either a treasure, a monster, or nothing. To navigate, users will have to type "Left" "Right", etc. Users will also be allowed to search the area they are in, potentially allowing them to find hidden potions or weapons. Once a user encounters a monster, a battle will engage, and the monster and user will take turns attacking. The monster and the user will deal damage based on their attack's strength. Monsters will have a base attack strength and user's weapons will have varying base attack strengths. Attacks will deal random damage based on those attack strengths. During battle a user can chose to switch weapons or eat a potion before attacking. If the user dies they lose, otherwise, they continue on. The goal is to find keys to unlock doors that will either unlock a new section of the cavern or finish their escape. In the main menu, users will decide difficulty. There are three difficulties, easy, medium, and hard.
